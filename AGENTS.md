# Dotfiles and Configs
This is a highly personalized config repository for the user's specific workflow.

If I request a change in dotfiles, look for them in this repository first.

The files are constantly being updated and tweaked for users' workflow.

The current preferences that might change
- Tmux over zellij
- Preferring Alacritty for terminal
- zsh and oh-my-zsh
- Custom Nvim config as editor
- aliases and scripts for workflow improvements

User uses the create_hardlinks.sh file to add configurations to the respective config directory.
